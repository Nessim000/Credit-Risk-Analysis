This project focuses on credit risk prediction, aiming to identify the likelihood of customer default based on financial and behavioral features. Using a dataset of 30,000 observations and 32 variables, the analysis applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and build a reliable prediction model. The Random Forest classifier was selected as the best-performing model due to its strong balance between predictive accuracy and interpretability, especially in handling imbalanced data.

In addition to the modeling, the project explores variable importance to highlight the financial behaviors most strongly linked to default risk. Key variables such as Utilization, Bill Trend, Total Payment, and Payment Ratio emerged as the most influential, offering practical insights for risk assessment.

Key aspects of this project include:

- Data preprocessing and balancing for imbalanced classification problems

- Random Forest model training and evaluation using metrics such as ROC-AUC and classification report

- Feature importance analysis to understand drivers of default risk

- Visualization of results and patterns through interactive Power BI dashboards

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning techniques to address a real-world problem in credit risk management, offering both technical rigor and actionable insights.
